"""
Get the protein structure files from the PDB and parse out the sequences
with BioPython, saving the structures as format pdbXXXX.ent.

Also, these structure files (which have all chains) are further parsed
by chain and saved in the SCOPe format (<SID>.ent)

The all-chain structure files are mainly for DaliLite.  The single chain
SCOPe SID files will be used with gtalign and proteogram methods.
